# Work-Description
This is about the work experience of TenJin Data Center network construction

# Quickly understanding
In this project, we basically worked with the server departments to set up a network of data centers in the Tenjin Data Center
Mainly including the use of routing protocols to make firewalls and Layer 3 and Layer 2 switches, routers and servers communicate with each otherã€‚
And through the fortigate combing and testing the policy to control traffic.

# Project introduction

# Organization structure
Firstly, design network of data center according to the informations and requirements. 
Here useless data means the data missing meaningful HTP images. After that we got a total 74 useful data.

Then, based on confirm the machine after discussion we classified those HTP images into two groups. The HTP image with the score below 12 was put into the high social isolation risk group otherwise it was put into the low social isolation risk group.

)

Next, we analyzed these two groups' images to find the similarities and differences and also refered to the related research about Huse-Tree-Person drawing test and finally we identified a set of socialty related features. And use these features as analyze pionts to analyze whether this guy are from social isolation risk or not.
